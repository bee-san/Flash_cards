# Flash cards

# Notice
## This program is no longer being devoloped.
## I suggest usng Ankii (http://ankisrs.net/) as they implement spaced repitional based learning alot better than this
## program. If you want to change this program or use this as a template, feel free to do so but use the MIT licensing I have ## provided.

This program was created and designed by me to act as a study aid.
It implements a basic flash card system to show you questiosn which you can answer.
It allows you to get questions from English, Maths or Computer Science; the three things i am studying.
All questions asked in class will be put onto this program.
If you want to add to this, please do!
